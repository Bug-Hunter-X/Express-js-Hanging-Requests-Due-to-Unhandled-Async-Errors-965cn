# Express.js Hanging Requests Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where asynchronous operations within request handlers can lead to hanging requests if errors are not properly handled.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that fetches user data asynchronously. However, it lacks error handling. If the asynchronous operation fails (e.g., database connection error), the response is never sent, resulting in a hanging request on the client side.  The client will wait indefinitely for a response.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler. It includes proper error handling using a `try...catch` block to catch potential errors during the asynchronous operation.  If an error occurs, it sends an appropriate error response to the client.
